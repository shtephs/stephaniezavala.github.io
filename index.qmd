## My Story

My journey into epidemiology began in the field. As a veterinary student in Mexico, I was vaccinating cats and dogs against rabies in both rural areas and city neighborhoods when I first understood the importance of epidemiology. Each shot was not only protecting animals but also preventing human cases. Around the same time, I became fascinated by disease surveillance and started following real time reports from WAHIS. That's when I truly realized how closely animal, human, and environmental health are connected.

Working as a vet across Mexico and the USA taught me something crucial: context matters. The same disease behaves differently depending on culture, economy, and environment. Numbers tell part of the story, but the human and animal experiences behind the data are just as important.

Now, whether I'm hiking in the Swiss Alps or researching tick-borne diseases, I look at the world through a One Health lens. Every tick I see is a small but telling signal of how the environment and human actions shape disease patterns.

What drives me? The same lesson I learned when I lost my childhood apiary to pests in Mexico, that prevention is key, and that small creatures can have enormous impacts in our world.
